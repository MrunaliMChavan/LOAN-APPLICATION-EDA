# LOAN-APPLICATION-EDA

This project focuses on analyzing and preprocessing data from a financial dataset 'application_data.csv'. It involves handling missing values, removing columns with over 50% missing data, imputing missing values, identifying and handling outliers, and conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA). 

EDA includes visualization of numerical and categorical variables, analyzing relationships between variables, and deriving insights. For instance, marital status seems to influence the fulfillment of annuity payments, cash loans are more likely to be repaid than revolving loans, and laborers are the largest group applying for loans. 

The project aims to gain insights into the dataset and prepare it for further analysis or modeling.
